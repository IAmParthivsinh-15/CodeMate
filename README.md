# CodeMate ♟️<>💻

> Where Chess Strategy Meets Coding Prowess.

CodeMate is a unique, gamified platform designed for individuals who love the intellectual challenge of both chess and programming. It merges the strategic world of chess with the problem-solving realm of coding, creating a one-of-a-kind training ground for your mind.

## ✨ Core Concept

Ever been stuck in a chess game, wishing for a hint? In CodeMate, you don't just get one—you **earn** it.

When playing against our AI bot, you can request a hint for the best next move. To unlock it, you must solve a randomly assigned coding challenge. Your code is submitted and validated in real-time. If you succeed, the Stockfish engine provides you with a strategic move. Fail, and you're back to the board on your own!

This core loop turns every game into a dynamic test of both your logical and strategic skills.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Play Chess**: Enjoy a clean chess interface to play against our powerful bot or in a classic pass-and-play mode with a friend.
*   **Code for a Hint**: The signature feature. When playing the bot, solve a coding problem to receive a hint from the world-class Stockfish chess engine.
*   **Real-time Code Evaluation**: Code submissions are planned to be evaluated instantly using the **Judge0** API, supporting multiple programming languages.
*   **User Profiles & Analytics**: (Upcoming) Track your chess ELO, your coding problem success rate, and see detailed performance analysis.

## 📊 Project Status

The project is divided into a backend service and a frontend client.

### ✅ Backend (Functionally Complete)

The backend is robust and ready. It handles all core logic, from user authentication to chess game state management.

*   **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
*   **Features**:
    *   Secure User Authentication (JWT)
    *   Full Chess Game Logic (move validation, check/checkmate detection)
    *   Game State Management & Database Integration
    *   **Stockfish Engine Integrated** for bot moves.
*   **DevOps**: The entire backend is containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated using **Kubernetes** for scalability and reliability.

> For a deep dive into the API, architecture, and setup, please see the **[backend/README.md](./backend/README.md)**.

### 🔜 Frontend (Planned)

The user interface is the next major milestone.

*   **Tech Stack**: React with TypeScript
*   **Status**: Development has not yet begun. The focus is on building a clean, intuitive, and responsive UI.
*   **Planned Features**:
    *   Chessboard interface
    *   User profile section
    *   Statistics and game history tracking
    *   In-game code editor
